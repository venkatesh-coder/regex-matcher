# regex-matcher

Simple Regex pattern matcher built in my path for learning process
This uses recursion to match patterns, it is based on brian kernighan's explanation of 
Rob Pike's simple regex code ([Regular expression matcher](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html)).
I added my own impleamentaions of range regex search e.g: [a-f] and,
any_of eg:[aeiou] pattern matching and so on.

# How to build
This is a simple program with simple makefile 
just run make on root folder, 
I will refactor the structure files soon.
